# Solar Power Generation Forecasting
* Create machine learning models that help solar power system operators to predict the solar power generation from PV panels.
* Interpretation of relationship between independent variables (meteorological and environmental factors) and dependent variables (solar power generation).
* Create and compare various machine learning models (polynomial, SVM, KNeighbors, Random Forest, XGBoost, and ANN regressor) that forecasting solar power generation.
* Optimize the machine learning models with GridSearchCV.
* Evaluate the machine learning models using regression evaluation metrics (R-squared, RMSE, MAE).

I was able to find the best machine learning model that forecasts the solar power generation from PV panels, which is Random Forest Regressor.
